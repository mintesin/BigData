## Interactive Data Visualization with Plotly

This project leverages Plotly for advanced, interactive data visualization in both the backend and frontend:

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook):** Utilizes Plotly to create interactive, publication-quality plots for in-depth data analysis and exploration.
- **React Frontend:** Integrates Plotly.js to deliver dynamic, user-friendly visualizations directly in the web interface, enabling seamless analytics and insight delivery to end users.

By using Plotly across both environments, the project ensures a consistent and powerful visualization experience, bridging backend analytics and frontend user experience.
