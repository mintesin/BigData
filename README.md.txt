1. General Information (Summary Stats)
Total number of packets captured

Total data volume (sum of frame lengths)

Count of unique protocols seen (e.g., TCP, UDP, SMB, NBDGM)

Packet count by transport protocol (TCP vs UDP)

Packet count by application protocol (e.g., SMB, NetBIOS, etc.)

Average packet size (frame.len)

Min/Max packet size

Number of unique IP addresses (src/dst IP count)

Number of unique MAC addresses (src/dst eth.addr count)

Top talkers (IP or MAC with highest packet counts)

Suggestion: Add counts of error packets (e.g., IP checksum errors, malformed packets), if available.

2. Time-Based Analysis (Transport & Application Layers)
Packets per time interval (e.g., per second/minute/hour) — overall and by protocol

Time delta between packets (frame.time_delta) — to measure latency or burstiness

Protocol usage trends over time (e.g., SMB usage spikes or lulls)

Cumulative bytes over time (total traffic volume growth)

3. Field Value Distribution (Protocol Details)
Distribution of IP flags (ip.flags) — e.g., fragmentation, DF bit

Distribution of UDP payload lengths (udp.length) — payload size histogram

Distribution of SMB flags or status/error codes (smb.flags, smb.error_code)

Distribution of NetBIOS Datagram flags (nbdgm.flags)

Other flags of interest depending on protocols present

Suggestion: Also consider analyzing TCP flags if TCP packets exist.

4. Time-Based Analysis (Link Layer)
Packets per time interval (frame.time) at link layer level (e.g., Ethernet)

Link layer frame size distribution (frame.len) over time

Link layer protocol type trends (e.g., Ethernet type: IPv4, ARP, IPv6)

MAC address usage trends over time (e.g., identify new devices appearing/disappearing)
